<h2>Problem Description</h2>
<p>Imagine that you are working in the recycling division of the department of energy. The government has
requested your division to identify the types of plastics found in the sea so that they can take necessary
actions to reduce or prevent their usage. You are required to nd the type of plastic, given its remains from
the sea.
Assume that there are only six different types of plastics. The compositions of plastics vary over a specic
range of values. You are provided with the data regarding the range of composition percentages, properties
and the corresponding types of plastic.
Find the type of plastic and help the government conserve marine life!
train_X.csv, train_Y.csv contains the corresponding data.
</p>
<h2>Note</h2>
<ul>
<li>predict.py should take ‘test_X_lepath’ as a command line argument and generate ‘predicted_test_Y_knn.csv’
in the same folder where the ‘predict.py’ is present</li>
<li>train.py helps in predicting the best value of k</li>
</ul>
