<ul><li>predict.py should take ‘test_X_lepath’ as a command line argument and generate ‘predicted_test_Y_lr.csv’ (name
of the le is case sensitive) in the same folder where the ‘predict.py’ le is present.</li>
<li>WEIGHTS_FILE.csv contains the calculated weights after training the model.<li></ul>
